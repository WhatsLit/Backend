### Git Branching Model
We're using Git to manage all of our source code and production. [Please learn git.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) We have a production branch (master) and a development branch (dev). There are a few things you need to know
 *  If you're developing, you push only to the development branch.
 * If you want to push to production, make a pull request or merge to make a new version.
 * Don't fuck this up.

### Backend-Frontend Protocol
Here will be some documentation for the protocol.
